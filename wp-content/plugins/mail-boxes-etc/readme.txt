MBE eShip, the Mail Boxes Etc.​'s plugin for e-commerce platforms​, ​functions as an integrator between your ​online store and the MBE​'s​ Systems

== Description ==

[Mail Boxes Etc.](https://www.mbeglobal.com/) is one of the world’s largest networks of retail centers offering logistic, communication and business support services to business and private customers. Operating in the Business Services Industry, MBE provides value by helping people and businesses - more precisely small and medium-sized enterprises - to improve productivity by outsourcing to MBE the business-related requirements and processes which do not correspond to customers’ core business activities. The local presence also guarantees that MBE’s distinct set of services is conveniently available to both professionals and consumers. This retail presence uniquely positions MBE to function in the “last mile” between companies - both large and small - and consumers, when service customization and a personal interaction are needed.

MBE eShip, the Mail Boxes Etc.​'s plugin for e-commerce platforms​, ​functions as an integrator between your ​online store and the MBE​'s​ Systems, allowing you to ​​offer different types of shipments and service​ levels​ to your customers, ​with all the distinctive quality ​and longstanding experience ​offered by Mail Boxes Etc. MBE e-Lin​​k is free of charge​, ​easy to install and configure, ​enabling automatic data transfer, such as recipient​s​, parcels​ information and tracking​ codes​, between MBE​'s​ ​Systems and the e-commerce​, ​allowing you ​to use only ​a ​single platform and stay focused on your business.
Although the plug-in download and installation are free of charge, the costs of shipments generated by it are based on the price list agreed between you and the MBE Center.
A separate account is required to use the plug-in, all the information will be provided by the MBE Center.

MBE eShip ​creates ​automatically ​the shipments for the products sold ​​through your e-commerce, letting you focus on ​matters strictly related to your ​business​,​ ​rather than ​bother on creat​ing and managing​ shipments manually in all their stages: the experts in MBE Center will take care of that for you. It also offers the ​possibility to ​create ​​shipping labels, avoiding the need to use different platform to download and print them. All the shipments' data will be accompanied by a tracking number, so customers will be able to track their orders' status since the very beginning.

MBE eShip lets you customize the destination countries and the service levels (standard or express), in order to always have control where your products can be shipped, and where not, at which cost. Price list customization is available by selecting the markup or the discount that you want to offer, free shipping option is available and manageable, based on customers or amount of their purchases. The connection between the plugin and MBE's Systems enables you to download real-time reports of your shipments.
